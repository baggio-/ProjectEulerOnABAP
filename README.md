# ProjectEulerOnABAP

Hello everyone,

Here I will be posting solutions using ABAP for Project Euler programming taks - https://projecteuler.net/archives
Copy TOP, do the PERFORM p# (where # is the problem number) of the specific problem.

I know solutions are not perfect, as sometimes it goes through unnecessary loops, are not the most optimized ones.

Please feel free to edit and show me faster ways.
Peace!

p.s. Forza Juve & Forza Kairat
