# ProjectEulerOnABAP

Hello everyone,

Here I will be posting solutions using ABAP for Project Euler programming tasks - https://projecteuler.net/archives
Copy the TOP and do the PERFORM p# (where # is the problem number) of the specific problem.

I know these solutions are far from being perfect, as sometimes it goes through unnecessary loops. 

Please feel free to edit, optimize and show me faster ways. (In fact I would very much appreciate such gesture)
Peace up!

p.s. Forza Juve
p.s.s. with love from Kazakhstan
