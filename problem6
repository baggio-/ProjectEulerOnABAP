* Problem p6.
*The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
*1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
*
*The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
*(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
*
*Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
*ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
*
*Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
*one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

FORM p6.
  DATA: sumsq TYPE i,
        sum   TYPE i.
  DO 100 TIMES.
    sumsq = sumsq + sy-index * sy-index. " sum of the squares
    sum = sum + sy-index. " sum of 1..100
  ENDDO.
  DATA(result) = sum * sum - sumsq.
  WRITE result.
ENDFORM.
